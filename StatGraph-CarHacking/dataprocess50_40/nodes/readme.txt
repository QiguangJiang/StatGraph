You can generate the node vector files required for training through "generate attack nodes.py" and "generate attack nodes.py", which process abnormal and normal data sets respectively and include three parts: graph property generation, data slice and data movement.

And then, you can get the node vector files after batch data merging through our "merge node vectors.py". Its output is three csv files named "train_nodes", "val_nodes" and "test_nodes".
