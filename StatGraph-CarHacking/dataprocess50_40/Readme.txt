This file contains the code for data processing and generated data is placed in the file "Dataset50_40".

Let TAG represent the type of attack data (source), TAG∈{1,2,3,4}.

Therein, each abnormal data will generate normal data set "0_TAG" and abnormal data set "TAG". All "TAG" data will be divided to train,val and test in the proportion of 70%, 20% and 10% respectively.
The normal dataset "0_TAG" (e.g. "0_1") generated by the attack dataset (e.g. Dos_Attack_Dataset) will become ("TAG+4") (e.g. ”5‘’) and be placed in the test dataset as a supplement to the normal data for more realistically simulating the abnormal proportion of data in the vehicle network.

For a normal data set, the files it generates are divided to the normal data "0/" in the "train/" folder and the normal data "0/" in the "val/" folder in a ratio of 80% and 20%.

It is worth noting that both the number of nodes (nnodes) and batchsize (batchsize) can be set by yourself. For example, we set nnodes=50 and batchsize=40.
