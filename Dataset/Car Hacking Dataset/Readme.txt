Car Hacking Dataset is provided by Hacking and Countermeasure Research Lab (HCRL) of Korea University through recording CAN traffic in a real vehicle.
The dataset includes one normal dataset and four different attack datasets: DoS, Fuzzy, spoofing GEAR and spoofing RPM.

Since the IDs in four different attack datasets are all hexadecimal, we provide the processed "normal_16_id.csv" dataset with hexadecimal IDs.

Above four different attack datasets and one normal dataset with decimal ID can be download in https://ocslab.hksecurity.net/Datasets/car-hacking-dataset and get the detailed explanation.
