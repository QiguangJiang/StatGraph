ROAD (Real ORNL Automotive Dynamometer) Dataset is collected from a passenger vehicle with a variety of CAN attacks, see paper Addressing the lack of comparability & testing in can intrusion detection research: A comprehensive guide to can ids data & introduction of the road dataset.
We choose five kinds of masquerade attacks: Deal_correlated_signal_attack_masquerade, Deal_max_speedometer_attack_masquerade, Deal_reverse_light_off_attack_masquerade, Deal_reverse_light_on_attack_masquerade and Deal_max_engine_coolant_temp_attack_masquerade. 
And we processed it in the same format as Car hacking Dataset.
