You can generate the node vector files required for training through our "generate nodes.py", which includes three parts: graph property generation, data slice and data movement.

An then, you can get the node vector files after batch data merging through our "merge node vector.py". Its output is three csv files named "train_nodes", "val_nodes" and "test_nodes".
